Made a journal. Decided on django. Created project outline on google docs. Had a good time doing so.

# Aug 18, 2022
Today my goal is to have most of the outline for the project sculpted so we have clear goals and structure to then "divvy out". It seems that the flow of the project combined with the daily work in class is a bit fragmented - it makes it hard to focus on this project with full attention. 

Created skeleton
installed react app
installed django - created 3 django projects, levels, accounts, and classes
configured all of the django settings, urls, databases, dockerfiles, gitignores, common, api structure, and optimized the file structure. 
Changed database from sqllite3 to postgres, imported dj_database_url to autofilter to correct database on all 3 services.
Installed bootstrap. Installed tailwind

uninstalled tailwind because paywall. 
full revamp after reinstall. 
added .env file for api keys
downloaded django rest api framework 
added localhost to the allowed hosts list on all 3 projects(will obviously have to fix later)
