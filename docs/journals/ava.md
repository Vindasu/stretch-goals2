We are just getting started with the outline idea of our project. We have decided on a yoga app for instructors to make accounts and upload their own demo videos, and schedule live streams to live student audiences (with a limit of attendees). Students can create accounts and sign up for instructor classes (live streams). Now, we are taking the time to look over our outline and divvy up the work between us. I am excited to finally start building! By the end of the week, we should have clearer ideas of our roles.

Today my goal is to have most of the outline for the project sculpted so we have clear goals and structure to then "divvy out". It seems that the flow of the project combined with the daily work in class is a bit fragmented - it makes it hard to focus on this project with full attention.

Today we started by working on the docker-compose file together. Dalonte hopped in and gave us very useful feedback on our MVP, so we made a few changes to it and discussed how to implement those changes, or turn them into 'stretch'. We edited the README file together to show those changes and provide further clarification. We ended by roughly discussing our individual roles in the project, and I feel comfortable moving forward.

Today we struggled a bit with Docker. Some group members' worked perfectly fine, while for others (including mine), the containers were not running properly. We spent a majority of the day figuring this out. We also discussed who will be working on what, and we decided that everyone will kinda do a mix of front-end and backend. Basically, we will work on the pieces together and help others when need be. Josh also helped explain how to write function components in the form of a hook, which I had some experience with from project beta, but the refresher was definitely useful for all of us. Overall, we were just focusing on getting the project up and running for everyone. Alex did a great job of creating a skeleton of the project for all of us, and even put together a rough idea of what we want our home page to look like. Definitely a stress-reliever for me as we started out the week a little frazzled and unorganized, but now I feel like we have a good basis of where to begin our independent work.

Today we started pair-programming. Carlos, Mindy and I worked on the front-end aspects. For the first portion of the day I shared my screen and created the Create Instructor form as well as the Create Student form, and we edited the App.js and Nav.js files. Basically, we made sure all our routes were working and we have a good base regarding the forms. Josh and Alex worked on the backend together. I would say we had a pretty successful work day. Compared to last week, it's nice to actually start writing code and see the progress being made. Tomorrow we will probably look into creating lists.
