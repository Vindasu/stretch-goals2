- We roughly discussed our individual roles in the project, and we all agreed that we will keep each other updated on the progress
- Josh did a mini lecture on React using functions instead of classes for the rest of our group as we all agreed to use functions for this project
- We all tried to run our project on Docker, and had some issues. The Docker containers were running fine for Alex and Josh, and weren't running correctly for Ava, Carlos, and me. We first disscussed together and tried to figur out the problem, and then the SEIRs (Allisha and Zach) came to help us. We finally have it fixed with Dalonte's help. I am glad that we can get Docker working and moving forward
