Our group ended up choosing Yoga classes and instructors as the topic. I tried to ask a lot of questions today because it's not my field of expertise but I did want a workable understanding of the field. Mostly we just tried to talk about goals and finish the readme. At this point, I'm still a little foggy on some things but I have enough of an understanding to start moving forward.

I wrote out a lot today in the docs. I feel pretty good about things now and since we are likely going to decide to go with django, I'm feeling confident that I can translate our ideas into actual code. I also am happy with my contributions. Personally I felt like I led a lot of the design discussion regarding the microservices and breakdown of the project. I primarily worked on the apis.md and data-models.md. Carlos took the lead on the ghi.md and wireframe drawings. Think he did an excellent job and I'm grateful he also included a rough domain design sketch.

Today was mostly just making sure everyone was on the same page and what tech stack we were agreeing to use. The topic of contention was back-end implementation using fastapi or django and we ultimately decided on django. I'm happy with that decision.

Talked about docker compose and started designing it together as a team of 5. Then we went over a review with Dalonte and received some feedback regarding our functionality so we decided to change classes to have videos instead of livestreams and keep livestreams as a strech goal while removing a payment structure from our goals. Finally, we updated to readme to have more clarification regarding what non-registered users can do. Currently, we're still in the process of figuring out who will be in charge of what. I'm hoping for back-end work but I think I will probably have to act as a fill and try to do what other people are uncomfortable doing.

Today we had to resolve a ton of docker issues. For some reason, the project containers were running fine for Alex and I but not for the rest of our group. Unfortunately, that headache took most of our time today but thanks to Dalonte, we did eventually manage to find a fix. While we were waiting, I gave a mini lecture on how to write react functional components and implementation of a search bar. We also discussed who will want to work on what area in the project so that we are ready to start working come monday. I'm feeling relieved that we fixed the docker issues.
