Day 1: Our group ended up choosing Yoga classes and instructors as the topic. I tried to ask a lot of questions today because it's not my field of expertise but I did want a workable understanding of the field. Mostly we just tried to talk about goals and finish the readme. At this point, I'm still a little foggy on some things but I have enough of an understanding to start moving forward.

Day 2: I wrote out a lot today in the docs. I feel pretty good about things now and since we are likely going to decide to go with django, I'm feeling confident that I can translate our ideas into actual code. I also am happy with my contributions. Personally I felt like I led a lot of the design discussion regarding the microservices and breakdown of the project. I primarily worked on the apis.md and data-models.md. Carlos took the lead on the ghi.md and wireframe drawings. Think he did an excellent job and I'm grateful he also included a rough domain design sketch.

Day 3: Today was mostly just making sure everyone was on the same page and what tech stack we were agreeing to use. The topic of contention was back-end implementation using fastapi or django and we ultimately decided on django. I'm happy with that decision.
